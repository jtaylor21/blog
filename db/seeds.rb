Post.create title: 'Hello world!', content: 'p>As part of the Code Academy learning experience, we have been asked to create a blog that chronicles our 3-month journey to learn Ruby on Rails. Rather than using a third-party blogging service, I finally took the opportunity to buy my own name as a domain. Tonight I setup vincentcabansag.com on HostGator, installed WordPress, several plug-ins, a clean theme and now have a live blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel like Iâ€™m cheating, but I plan to recreate this blog using Rails. That should be an interesting and fun project. Enjoy the blog!</p>', permalink: 'hello-world%21'
